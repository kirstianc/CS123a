Bioinformatics definition
 - intersection of 3 disciplines, sciences (biology/chem) + cs (computation) + math (biostatistics)
 - anthing relating to biological data (processing, storing, computation, creating models, etc)
 - python 3.10(?)

bio central dogma, how we go from blue print to worker bees (DNA to protein)

DNA - transcription -> mRNA - translation -> protein

transcription -> RNA polymerase duplicates specific DNA strand -> replace Thymine (T) w Uracil (U) --> pre-mRNA 

alternative splicing of pre-mRNA after transcripting (removes unnecessary RNA pieces) --> mRNA

eukaryote (higher lvl organisms)
- has nucleus (contains DNA), 
- animal/plants

prokaryote (single celled organism)
- no cell nucleus, 
- archea/bacteria

archea 
- live in extreme domains

nucleotide (building block of DNA)
- phosphate, sugar, base (letter)
- if no phosphate -> nucleoside

in DNA OH (hydroxal only in third position 3')
in RNA OH (hydroxal in third position 3' and second position 2')

bases are bonded with hydrogen
A-T (double hydrogen bonds)
C-G (triple hydrogen bonds)

purine (Guanine and Adenine)
- 2 cyclogroups (two circles of molecules)

pyrimidine (Cytosine, Uracil, Thymine)
- 1 cyclogroup (one circle of molecules)

a purine always pairs w pyrimidine and vice versa (mutations can lead to wrong pairings --> bad problems but body usually catches)

phosphates connect using 3' and 5'

3' end of chain and 5' end of chain (inverse order for other side of DNA)

genome set of all instructions

DNA replication -> partial conservation (since DNA strand in half, molecules create other half using corresponding purines/pyrimidines)

mistakes occur every ~10^9 nucleotides copied
- homologous recombination: nick (gap) in original DNA code, open strands -> strand invasion where duplicated strand acts as original part of DNA
	- can be good (mutation) but usually bad
- chromosome crossing over occurs in meiosis

Transcription
- rRNA, mRNA, tRNA, miRNA, ribozyme, U1RNA

5' - 3'
- upstream - negative 
- downstream - positive 

3' - 5'
- upstream - positive
- downstream - negative

potential problems w transcription
- mutation in genes
- missing or pre-mature stop signals

pre-mRNA -> mRNA (inside cell nucleus)
- exon (needed dna sequence)
- intron (unncessary dna sequence)

DNA replication involves extending a complementary DNA strand
- dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP
- involves performing a nucleophilic attack (explain??)

Triples of RNA (codon) specify amino acid (e.g. AUG = M, AAA = K...)
- only one start codon
- can have multiple stop codons
- built in redundancies (e.g. UUU = UUC = same amino acid) for protection

RNA polymerase looks for DNA template strand 3'-->5' direction
transcription is 3'-->5' direction but generates pre-mRNA in 5'-->3' direction 
---------------------------------------------
Exercise:
What is the amino acid (AA) sequence that would be formed from the following DNA sequence? Show the mRNA sequence.
3'-TACGCCTATTTCAACAGGCGCGGGACT-5'

	5'-AUG CGG AUA AAG UUG UCG GCG CCC UGA-3'
	   Met Arg Ile Lys Leu Ser Ala Pro Stop
	   M   R   I   K   L   S   A   P   *

Is this the only DNA sequence that can produce the AA sequence? If not, provide an alternative.

	No, you can have multiple codon sequences that produce the same AA sequence.
	e.g. ATG AGA ATT AAA CTT TCT GCT CCA TAA
		Met Arg Ile Lys Leu Ser Ala Pro Stop
		M   R   I   K   L   S   A   P   *

What is the sense strand sequence that might have resulted in the following AA sequence? Are there other possible sense strands?
MPPKILLQETTVFLDG

	ATG CCC AAA GAA TTG GAA CAA TTA GAC

---------------------------------------------

Missense mutation
- change in one nucleotide
- can be good or bad
- e.g. sickle cell anemia (glutamic acid -> valine)

Nonsense mutation
- change in one nucleotide
- premature stop codon
- e.g. cystic fibrosis (glutamic acid -> stop codon)

Deletion mutation
- deletion of one nucleotide
- e.g. cystic fibrosis (glutamic acid -> stop codon)

Duplication mutation
- duplication of one nucleotide
- e.g. cystic fibrosis (glutamic acid -> stop codon)

Frameshift mutation
- insertion or deletion of one nucleotide
- e.g. Tay-Sachs disease (hexosaminidase A)

Repeat Expansion mutation
- insertion of one or more nucleotides
- e.g. Huntington's disease (huntingtin protein)
---------------------------------------------

Foundation of Amino Acids
- amino acids bond using peptide bonds
- hydrophobic sides bend inwards, hydrophilic sides bend outwards --> leading to shapes
- shape determines function, function determines shape

Chaperonins (double checks folded proteins)
- help fold proteins
