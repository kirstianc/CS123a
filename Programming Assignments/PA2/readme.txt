CS123a Programming Assignment 2, Ian Chavez

To run PA2.py properly, ensure these files are in the same directory as PA2.py:
    - cs123a_list_of_acc_nums.txt 
    - cs123a_list_of_species_gc_count.txt

Inside of the save_fasta() function, input your email of choice to download FASTA files using Entrez.
This function will save your designated accession numbers under a txt file entitled "cs123a_fasta_files".

For GitHub purposes, the cs123a_fasta_files.txt file has been deleted as it is 3+GB for this assignment.
It kept failing to push to the repository.
