## ***CS123A Module 1 Week 1 Reading***

### **BIOLOGY CENTRAL DOGMA & DNA, RNA, BIOLOGY BASICS**
>### 1. In the Publications folder of Module 1 Week 1, read Chapter 1 of the file entitled “Supratim Choudhuri_Bioinformatics for Beginners_CH_1.pdf”

1.1 BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES, GENOMICS, AND BIOINFORMATICS
- genetic info stored as bio macromolecules (nucleic acids/proteins)

1.2 DNA AS THE UNIVERSAL GENETIC MATERIAL
- DNA is universal genetic material (some exceptions)
- RNA Viruses (ribovirus)
    : retrovirus - RNA virus but unique bc during life cycle, has both RNA and DNA versions of their genome --> virus uses host cell to make reverse transcriptase enzyme to make provirus (viral DNA genome) which incorporates into host genome --> host cell makes more retroviruses

1.3 DNA DOUBLE HELIX
- double-stranded right handed helix
- 2 strands of DNA are antiparallel (the 2 strands have opposite 5'-3' orientation) and complementary (base pairings)
- composed of nucleotides (phosphate group, pentose sugar, nitrogenous base)
- 5' end has free phosphate group, 3' end has free hydroxyl group (OH)
- A, G are purines (2 rings), C, T are pyrimidines (1 ring)
    : A-T, G-C
    : A-U, G-C (RNA)
- Chargaff's Rule: purine/pyrimidine ratio is 1:1 (or as close as possible)
- Codon: 3 nucleotides that code for an amino acid

1.4 Conformations of DNA
- Z-DNA: left handed helix, zigzag backbone
- A-DNA: right handed helix, shorter and wider than B-DNA
- B-DNA: right handed helix, most common form of DNA

1.5 TYPICAL EUKARYOTIC GENE STRUCTURE
- transcriptions: DNA --> RNA, 1 strand of DNA is transcribed into RNA
    : strand not transcribed is called coding strand (same sequence as mRNA)
    : strand transcribed is called template strand (complementary to mRNA)
- pre-mRNA: primary transcript, contains introns and exons
    : introns: noncoding regions (removed by splicing)
    : exons: coding regions (important for protein synthesis)
