NCBI db

Genomic Context (e.g. HBB)
- Location: 11p15.4 (chromosome 11, short arm (p), block 15, sub-block 4)
	- centromere: middle of chromosome
		: p = short arm/side, q = long arm/side
		: lower # = closer to centromere, higher # = farther from centromere
		: banding (blocking) pattern (e.g. 11p15.4) = block 15, sub-block 4
		: when given base pairs, start from end of chromosome
- Exon count: 3
- if says "complement", then the sequence is reversed in the db (i.e. 3'-5' instead of 5'-3') - (reverse/template strand)

if complement -> FASTA file -> look for "TAC" for start (3' - 5' DNA, if RNA "UAC")
if not complement -> FASTA file -> look for "ATG" for start (5' - 3' DNA, if RNA "AUG")

related organisms:
- look under Organisms on the left side of the page -> might be listed like "blah, blah, blah"
- landing page, might display additional organisms
