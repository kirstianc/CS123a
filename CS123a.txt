CS123a

Bioinformatics definition
 - intersection of 3 disciplines, sciences (biology/chem) + cs (computation) + math (biostatistics)
 - anthing relating to biological data (processing, storing, computation, creating models, etc)
 - python 3.10(?)

bio central dogma, how we go from blue print to worker bees (DNA to protein)

DNA - transcription -> mRNA - translation -> protein

transcription -> RNA polymerase duplicates specific DNA strand -> replace Thymine (T) w Uracil (U) --> pre-mRNA 

alternative splicing of pre-mRNA after transcripting (removes unnecessary RNA pieces) --> mRNA

eukaryote (higher lvl organisms)
- has nucleus (contains DNA), 
- animal/plants

prokaryote (single celled organism)
- no cell nucleus, 
- archea/bacteria

archea 
- live in extreme domains

nucleotide (building block of DNA)
- phosphate, sugar, base (letter)
- if no phosphate -> nucleoside

in DNA OH (hydroxal only in third position 3')
in RNA OH (hydroxal in third position 3' and second position 2')

bases are bonded with hydrogen
A-T (double hydrogen bonds)
C-G (triple hydrogen bonds)

purine (Guanine and Adenine)
- 2 cyclogroups (two circles of molecules)

pyrimidine (Cytosine, Uracil, Thymine)
- 1 cyclogroup (one circle of molecules)

a purine always pairs w pyrimidine and vice versa (mutations can lead to wrong pairings --> bad problems but body usually catches)

phosphates connect using 3' and 5'

3' end of chain and 5' end of chain (inverse order for other side of DNA)

genome set of all instructions

DNA replication -> partial conservation (since DNA strand in half, molecules create other half using corresponding purines/pyrimidines)

mistakes occur every ~10^9 nucleotides copied
- homologous recombination: nick (gap) in original DNA code, open strands -> strand invasion where duplicated strand acts as original part of DNA
	- can be good (mutation) but usually bad
- chromosome crossing over occurs in meiosis

Transcription
- rRNA, mRNA, tRNA, miRNA, ribozyme, U1RNA

5' - 3'
- upstream - negative 
- downstream - positive 

3' - 5'
- upstream - positive
- downstream - negative

potential problems w transcription
- mutation in genes
- missing or pre-mature stop signals

pre-mRNA -> mRNA (inside cell nucleus)
- exon (needed dna sequence)
- intron (unncessary dna sequence)

DNA replication involves extending a complementary DNA strand
- dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP
- involves performing a nucleophilic attack (explain??)

Triples of RNA (codon) specify amino acid (e.g. AUG = M, AAA = K...)
- only one start codon
- can have multiple stop codons
- built in redundancies (e.g. UUU = UUC = same amino acid) for protection

RNA polymerase looks for DNA template strand 3'-->5' direction
transcription is 3'-->5' direction but generates pre-mRNA in 5'-->3' direction 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise:
What is the amino acid (AA) sequence that would be formed from the following DNA sequence? Show the mRNA sequence.
3'-TACGCCTATTTCAACAGGCGCGGGACT-5' --> template strand

	5'-AUG CGG AUA AAG UUG UCG GCG CCC UGA-3'
	   Met Arg Ile Lys Leu Ser Ala Pro Stop
	   M   R   I   K   L   S   A   P   *

Is this the only DNA sequence that can produce the AA sequence? If not, provide an alternative.

	No, you can have multiple codon sequences that produce the same AA sequence.
	e.g. ATG AGA ATT AAA CTT TCT GCT CCA TAA
		Met Arg Ile Lys Leu Ser Ala Pro Stop
		M   R   I   K   L   S   A   P   *

What is the sense strand sequence that might have resulted in the following AA sequence? Are there other possible sense strands?
MPPKILLQETTVFLDG

	ATG CCC AAA GAA TTG GAA CAA TTA GAC

---------------------------------------------

Missense mutation
- change in one nucleotide
- can be good or bad
- e.g. sickle cell anemia (glutamic acid -> valine)

Nonsense mutation
- change in one nucleotide
- premature stop codon
- e.g. cystic fibrosis (glutamic acid -> stop codon)

Deletion mutation
- deletion of one nucleotide
- e.g. cystic fibrosis (glutamic acid -> stop codon)

Duplication mutation
- duplication of one nucleotide
- e.g. cystic fibrosis (glutamic acid -> stop codon)

Frameshift mutation
- insertion or deletion of one nucleotide
- e.g. Tay-Sachs disease (hexosaminidase A)

Repeat Expansion mutation
- insertion of one or more nucleotides
- e.g. Huntington's disease (huntingtin protein)
---------------------------------------------

Foundation of Amino Acids
- Ribosome uses RNA to make proteins --> chains of amino acids bonded using peptide bonds (covalent bonds of carbon and nitrogen)
- hydrophobic sides bend inwards, hydrophilic sides bend outwards --> leading to shapes
- shape determines function, function determines shape

Chaperonins (double checks folded proteins)
- help fold proteins (refolds if necessary basically)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
n-terminus: amino group (start)
c-terminus: carboxyl group (end)
residues: amino acids in a protein

Polypeptide v Protein
- 100< amino acids = polypeptide
- 100>= amino acids = protein

Primary structure (sequence of AA)
- peptide bonds between amino acids (the order)

Secondary structure (alpha helix, beta sheet)
- hydrogen bonds between amino acids (the shape)
- alpha helix: spiral shape
- beta sheet: flat shape

Tertiary structure (3D shape)
- multiple combinations of secondary structures to form protein in 3D shape

Quaternary structure (multiple polypeptides)
- polypeptides that are physically close to each other to form the protein

(what are the white segments of the figures shown?)
- the parts where other proteins can bind to the protein

- usually inside are hydrophobic, outside are hydrophilic

Sequence Alignment
- aligning sequences to find similarities

: Pairwise Alignment - aligning two sequences for relatedness
: Multiple Alignment - aligning 3+ sequences for relatedness
: Global Alignment - aligning entire sequences
: Local Alignment - aligning parts of sequences (find subset of sequences that are similar)

P Value - significance measure to tell you how likely it is that the alignment is due to random events
	: low value if you want the alignment to not be due to random events
E value - expected number of alignments with the same score or better that would occur by chance
	: low value if you want the alignment to not be due to random events

3 algorithms include:
: Dot Matrix Method
: Dynamic Programming
: Word Method

Definitions
: Similarity - quantitative measure based on sequence identity and pairwise alignment
	- Seq Sim = # of positions that match / length of sequence
: Identity - qualitative measure based on sequence similarity and pairwise alignment
: Homology - extrapolated from similarity and usually implies an evolutionary link
: Orthologs - genes separated by speciation and typically have same function, 3D structure, and domain structure
	- domain structure - part of protein that has a specific function
: Paralogs - genes separated by duplication and typically have different function, 3D structure, and domain structure

Dotplot Method (Dot Matrix)
- compares two sequences by plotting one sequence on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis
- dot is placed where characters match at intersections 
: useful for identifying regions of biological importance

Cytochrome C Alignment example
- What is Cytochrome C?

Good Alignment hit on BLAST 
- low E value (close to 0)
- high ident (close to 100%)
- high sim (close to 100%)

T-Score = (S - m) / s where S = score, m = mean, s = standard deviation
Alignments whose T score do not decrease are compared to scores from random searches
- if T score is higher than random searches, then the alignment is significant

Similarity Score - score that is calculated based on the number of matches and mismatches
- higher score = more similar = more likely to be related
- lower score = less similar = less likely to be related
- use corresponding matrix to calculate score (e.g. BLOSUM62)
	: BLOSUM62 - matrix created w 62 similarity score
	: PAM250 - matrix created w 250 similarity score
	- e.g. comparing caveman and human today use a lower matrix score (e.g. BLOSUM62) since they are more likely to be different over time
		(you would prefer like BLOSOM45 compared to BLOSOM90 in this case)

Local alignment - aligning parts of sequences (find subset of sequences that are similar)
- basically randomly align sequence and calculate T score and find highest T score/reaches threshold
- add to left and right until score decreases
- align left of sequence to left of T-score sequence and right of sequence to right of T-score sequence
- repeat (can insert gaps if necessary)

Calculate T Score
- T = (S - m) / s

using blosom62 matrix
M E N G G P A P E S 
I P A G G P A P E S 

word size of 3
M  E  N
1 -1 -2 = -2
I  P  A 

C word location --> T Score threshold
- add letters to left and right of C word
	- if T score is higher than before -> continue
	- if T score is lower than before -> stop

Calculate S score (similarity score)

=============================================

Protein Function --> mainly depends on 3D structure, not necessarily sequence

Sequence Conservation implies Function
- if sequence is conserved, then function is conserved 

Similarity Score = # of matches / length of sequence

PAM (Point Accepted Mutation) Matrix
- matrix defines a time unit where 1 PAM is the time it takes for 1% of the amino acids to change
- PAM1 matrix shows prob of amino acid at column j being replaced by aminog acid at row i 
- PAM250 matrix shows prob of amino acid at column j being replaced by aminog acid at row i after 250 PAMs
	: each value would be put to the power of 250 (multiply by itself)

Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) - aligning 3+ sequences for relatedness
	: Conserved Residues - residues that are the same in all sequences (same organism) --> MSA helps find these

Ortholog - genes separated by speciation and typically have same function, 3D structure, and domain structure
Paralog - genes separated by duplication and typically have different function, 3D structure, and domain structure
---------------------------------------------
Phylogenetic Tree 
- tree that shows evolutionary relationships between organisms
- branch length = evolutionary distance

---------------------------------------------
UPGMA Tree Creation 
- Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean
- used to create phylogenetic trees
- used to find evolutionary relationships between organisms
- basically:
	> find smallest distance between 2 organisms in the matrix
	> combine those 2 organisms into one organism (i.e. A, B -> AB)
		> AB = (A + B) / 2
	> create new matrix with AB and all other organisms
	> repeat until all organisms are combined into one organism

---------------------------------------------
Neighbor-Joining Tree algorithm
- does not assume constant rate of evolution (atomic clock) --> advantage? use a longer time period between organisms
(UPGMA better for constant or relatively constant rate of evolution)
- rooted tree -> tree with a root (i.e. common ancestor)
- additive -> sum of branch lengths = distance between organisms
- basically:
	> calculate divergence/disimilarity score (sum of all distances between organisms, i.e. all A distances, all B distances, etc)
	> recalculate matrix with divergence score (A distance - (A score + B score) / (n-2))
		n = # of OTU's (organisms)
		subtract 2 bc we are combining 2 organisms into one
	> repeat until all organisms are combined into one organism

---------------------------------------------
Gene Editing
- i.e. CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)
- underlying idea came from bacteria protecting themselves from viruses
- bacteria have CRISPR array that contains spacer sequences (i.e. DNA from viruses) that are used to recognize 
	and destroy viruses' DNA that are injected. After the bacteria defends itself, they cut the DNA and
	insert it into the CRISPR array as a spacer sequence. The spacer sequence is then used to recognize the
	virus' DNA in the future and destroy it.
