========================== MODIFICATION HISTORY ==============================
09/26/23:
    MOD:     Creation of file and initial organization
    AUTHOR:  Ian Chavez
    COMMENT:
    - Changed package from pairwise2 to Align based on error:
    "BiopythonDeprecationWarning: Bio.pairwise2 has been deprecated, and we intend to remove it in a future release of Biopython. As an alternative, please consider using Bio.Align.PairwiseAligner as a replacement, and contact the Biopython developers if you still need the Bio.pairwise2 module."

    - Addressed following overflow error by using documentation found at: http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html
    "OverflowError: number of optimal alignments is larger than 9223372036854775807"

    - Getting ValueError from running
    "ValueError: sequence contains letters not in the alphabet"
    
10/17/23:
    MOD:     Part 1 done
    AUTHOR:  Ian Chavez
    COMMENT:
    - Changed back to pairwise2 to keep consistent with assignment. 
    Not trying to lose points because of a warning.

    - Addressed multiple errors and warnings by using documentation found at: http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html
